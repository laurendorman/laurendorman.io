## What was your approach for designing this?

I honestly just wanted to have fun with it. I wanted it to be playful and bright. Something that could be displayed as art. It started with a sketch of wave forms and it transformed into something that feels nostalgic. It reminds me of summer as a kid. Remember Super Soakers? A Super Soaker 2000 is like $100-$150 on eBay. Thatâ€™s insane to me.
