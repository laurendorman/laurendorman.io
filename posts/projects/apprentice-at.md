description: 'A marketplace for apprenticeships â€“Â where eager learners and companies meet.'
role: Development

[Apprentice.at](https://apprentice.at) is a marketplace where aspiring designers and developers can find apprenticeships and companies can submit their programs. Katie, Dan, and I built Apprentice.at as our final project to showcase what we learned as apprentices at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com).

Our goal was to provide a central location to find apprenticeship programs. With Apprentice.at you can learn about the companies, their programs, and how to apply. We also provided information about what apprenticeships are and why they're beneficial to both parties.
