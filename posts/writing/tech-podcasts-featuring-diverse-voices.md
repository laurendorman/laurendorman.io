A few months back, I began building my podcast library in search of tech podcasts to listen to during my commute to and from work as a way to stay up to date with what’s taking place in the industry. I quickly began to realize that many of the podcasts that I was recommended failed to feature diverse voices and only offer limited views. I decided to share the podcasts that I found on my journey that open their doors to underrepresented groups.

## Revision Path
Revision Path shares the stories of people of color working in tech from founders to developers who are just getting their start in the industry. In Episode 50, host [Maurice Cherry](https://twitter.com/mauricecherry) speaks with [Angelica Ross](https://twitter.com/angelicaross), founder of TransTech, covering the web as safe place to work, utilizing the web to learn and the challenges of finding funding as an LGBTQ member and person of color.

Their podcast, hosted by founder [Saron Yitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek), introduces programming enthusiasts to industry leaders and newbies alike, telling the story of their coding journeys. In Episode 48, [Nicole Dominguez](https://twitter.com/sodevious) of Sawhorse Media discusses learning to code with Neopets pages, her journey from freelance to full-time as a self-taught designer and front-end developer, why she decided to leave college and _working with people who look like you_.

## Two Black Nerds
Two Black Nerds is a podcast hosted by software engineer [Iheanyi Ekechukwu](https://twitter.com/kwuchu) and mechanical engineer [Romeo Kwihangana](https://twitter.com/kwiromeo), two Notre Dame graduates who discuss their day to day lives after graduation.

## Slack Variety Pack
Slack is a company that is known for their intent to create a diverse team. From their culture team, the [Earthtones](https://medium.com/@uxdiogenes/just-a-brown-hand-313db35230c5), to their marketing efforts – Slack is an active advocate for diversity and inclusion in tech. Although Variety Pack is slightly newer podcast, my guess is that their podcast efforts will be no different. In Episode 5, Slack covers the origin of the elevator pitch, talks smart watches and speaks with founders [Kaya Thomas](https://twitter.com/kthomas901) of We Read Too and [Kimberly Bryant](https://twitter.com/6Gems) of Black Girls Code.
