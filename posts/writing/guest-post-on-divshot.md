I was given the opportunity to help write a guest post for [Sparkbox](http://seesparkbox.com) on [Divshot's](http://divshot.io) blog.

I wrote about our experience teaching the Girl Scouts of Western Ohio how to build and deploy their own websites. We wanted to be sure that deployment was easy and didn't require CLI or FTP. We taught the girls how to ZIP up their websites and upload them to the web. Divshot made this extremely easy and asked us to share our experience.
