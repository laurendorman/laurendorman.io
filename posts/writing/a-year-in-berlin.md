Time sure does fly.

December 27th marked my one year anniversary in Berlin. üá©üá™

A little over year ago I moved to Berlin to join [A Color Bright](http://acolorbright.com). It would be a major transition for me &mdash;¬†as I had spent most of my life living in the calm storm known as the Midwest. There was no way to prepare for the journey I would be embarking on but I knew that it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. I took the leap.

After I got settled in the city, I began taking a 3-month A1 Deutsch course at the Volkeschule. I was excited about the language and was learning at a fair pace. It was a course for beginners, so we started by learning basic grammar &mdash; placement of verbs, how to pair masculine and feminine Artikels with items, conversation skills, etc.

In April, nearly halfway through the course, my mother was diagnosed with Stage 3A lung cancer. My concentration immediately fled and the only thing on my mind was getting back to the States to be with her. As an only child, I needed to be there.

I traveled home in May to spend quality time with my mother before her procedure. The surgeon thought that they would be able to remove only the mass, but ultimately ended up removing two-thirds of her right lung and part of her chest wall. I cannot image the pain that she felt and is still going through today. But she is not one to complain &mdash; and somehow she managed to keep smiling through it all.

Her treatment wasn't over after surgery, she still had two major chemotherapy sessions to undergo. The result of those two treatments left her with neuropathy &mdash;¬†a tingling sensation in her feet that is painful to the touch. And to no surprise, she still doesn't let it keep her down. She is now cancer-free and recovering well.

When I returned to Berlin, it felt like I had moved here for the first time again,¬†but this time with a heavier heart. I learned that nothing in this life is by mistake. Everything that happens is by design.

I had a spiritual awakening during this time. It brought me closer to my beliefs and those I hold near. I am now much more aware of the cause and effect of every action. It taught me to be more attentive, of service to others, and to love in a new light.

To say that it shaped a larger part of my year would be an understatement.

## What else happened?

### I traveled. A lot.

I traveled to San Francisco, San Jose, Toledo, Detroit, Chicago, Boston, Stockholm, Malm√∂, Paris, Copenhagen, Cologne, Amsterdam, Reykjavik, Mexico City, and likely a few others that have slipped my mind. It was a great year of travel for me and I plan to do even more this year.

### I spoke at two conferences.

I gave my first-ever long-form talk at **CONFRONT** in Malm√∂ and a quick lightening talk on Tachyons at **CSSConf EU** here in Berlin. I've found that no matter dry runs I go through, I will always be nervous when first arriving on stage. Luckily, after a few minutes, I find my comfort zone and stop tripping over words. **CONFRONT** was an amazing experience and was very well-received by the audience which has encouraged to write my first CFP. Wish me luck!

### I had a guest appearance on a podcast.

I was interviewed by Maurice Cherry for [Episode #193](https://revisionpath.com/lauren-dorman/) of Revision Path. I talked about how I got into design, what led me to development, what inspires me, and what I'm working on today. Available now on [Revision Path](https://revisionpath.com/lauren-dorman/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/revisionpath/episode-193-lauren-dorman), and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3MHZeqjFrwnx8gMNojTwpG).

### I started a newsletter.

Last year I started a tiny newsletter named LAP &mdash; short for Letters from Across the Pond &mdash; which has since been renamed and on hiatus. I renamed the newsletter because LAP no longer resonated with me. I went on a vision quest to rename my newsletter and settled on **Hurdle**. My vision is for **Hurdle** to be a mid-week pick me up that celebrates small wins and discoveries through introspect. Hurdle will start rolling out in February &mdash; more on that soon. [Subscribe now](https://buttondown.email/laurendorman) so that you don't miss the first issue under the new format.

### I became more active.

I spent many mornings in the gym with my personal trainer in my hometown when visiting my mother. It was a way for me to keep a clear mind and while fostering a healthy lifestyle. As a result, I actually enjoy running now. I am still finding my rhythm and trying to incorporate running into my daily morning routine.

## In conclusion

2017 was a year of challenges and triumphs.

2018 will be one hell of a ride. ü§òüèΩ
