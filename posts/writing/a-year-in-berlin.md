Time sure does fly.

December 27th marked my one year anniversary in Berlin. 🇩🇪

A little over year ago I moved to Berlin to join [A Color Bright](http://acolorbright.com). It was a big leap for me &mdash; as I had spent most of my life living in the Midwest. There was no way to prepare for the journey that I was embarking on but I knew that it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. I went with it.

After I got settled in the city, I began taking a 3-month A1 Deutsch course at the Volkeschule. I was excited about the language and was learning at a fair pace. It was a course for beginners, so we started by learning basic grammar &mdash; placement of verbs, how to pair masculine and feminine Artikels with items, conversation skills, etc.

In April, nearly halfway through the course, my mother was diagnosed with Stage 3A lung cancer. My concentration immediately fled and the only thing on my mind was getting back to the States to visit her. As an only child, I needed to be there.

A part of my treat

2017 was a year of challenges and triumphs.

2018 will be one hell of a ride. 🤘🏽
