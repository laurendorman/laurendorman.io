## [HTML5](){:name='html5'}
The use of HTML5 should strictly follow the [HTML5 W3 Specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/). For browser support, use [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/#cats=HTML5).

### <a name='doctype'>Doctype</a>
Enforce standards mode and more consistent rendering in every browser by declaring the HTML5 Doctype at the beginning of every HTML page.

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
~~~

### <a name='writing-html-syntax'>Writing HTML Syntax</a>
- Use a soft tab (two spaces), so that the HTML is rendered the same across browsers.
- Nested elements should be indented once per level.
- When an attribute requires it, use single quotes unless for content.
- Use lowercase and dashes, not underscore or camelCase.
- Do not include trailing slash in self-closing elements.

### <a name='spacing'>Spacing</a>
Large sections of HTML should be separated by a one line break for readability.

~~~html
<main>
  <section>
    ...
  </section>

  <section>
    ...
  </section>
</main>
~~~

### <a name='urls'>URLs</a>
Use relative URLs whenever possible; this will prevent problems if the base URL ever changes during a project's lifespan.

~~~html
<a href='/about' title="About">About</a>
~~~

## <a name='sass'>Sass</a>
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is my preferred choice for CSS preprocessing, it allows the author to add variables, nesting, functions, and mixins to their stylesheets. This document uses Sass syntax.

### <a name='variables'>Variables</a>

Write global variables just as you would a CSS declaration, but optionally include one line break and comments between related variables for grouping and readability.

~~~scss
/* Colors */
$c--primary: #5B3C70;
$c--secondary: #E57B5D;
$c--primary-text: #0d0d0d;

/* Typography */
$font-stack: 'proxima-nova', Helvetica, sans-serif;

/* Base Styles */
$base-margin: 2rem;
$base-padding: 1rem;
$base-border: 0.25rem solid;
$base-border-radius: 0.125rem;
~~~

When writing local variables, include them as you would a CSS declaration, but always declare them before usage.

~~~scss
.example {
  $base: 2em;
  height: $base;
  width: $base;
  margin: $base/2;
}
~~~

It is a best practice to include your variables in a separate stylesheet (partial) titled ~_variables.scss~ and import that stylesheet into your main ~style.scss~ stylesheet where your Sass sources are being compiled.

When importing, do not include the ~.scss~ file extension or prepending underscore.

~~~scss
@import 'utilities/variables';
~~~

### <a name='functions'>Functions</a>
~~~
Documentation in progress.
~~~

### <a name='mixins'>Mixins</a>
~~~
Documentation in progress.
~~~

### <a name='nesting'>Nesting</a>
Avoid nesting too deeply Sass for the sake of it. Things can get pretty ugly, pretty quickly.

~~~scss
.content__list {
  ul {
    li {
      a {
        &::hover {
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

The result will not be good.

~~~css
.content__list { ... }
.content__list ul { ... }
.content__list ul li { ... }
.content__list ul li a { ... }
.content__list ul li a:hover { ... }
~~~

Do not nest more than 3 levels deep.

### <a name='class-names'>Class Names</a>
- Use the BEM (block, element, modifier) methodology for naming things, i.e., ~btn__text--sold-out~.
- Be specific when naming classes. Use meaningful names that describe the action or functionality of a class rather than is appearance, i.e., ~.btn--danger~ instead of ~.btn--red~.
- Abbreviate some class names, but make sure anyone can understand the class, i.e., ~.cta~ instead of ~.call-to-action~.
- Prefix classes based on the closest parent element or base class.

## <a name='css'>CSS</a>
The use of CSS should strictly follow the [CSS W3 Specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/) for CSS properties and values. For browser support, use [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/#cats=CSS).

### <a name='writing-css-syntax'>Writing CSS Syntax</a>
- For readability, use a soft tab (two spaces).
- Nested elements (in Sass) should be indented with a soft tab.
- Include one space after the ~:~ for each declaration.
- Each individual declaration should be written on its own line and indented with a soft tab.
- End each declaration with a semi-colon.

### <a name='properties-and-values'>Properties and Values</a>
- Avoid specifying units for zero values, i.e., ~margin: 0;~ instead of ~margin: 0px~;
- Use shorthand whenever possible, i.e., ~font~ instead of ~font-size~ and ~font-family~ â€“ be very intentional with typography.
- Use ~!important~ when necessary, but this should be avoided.
- Use single quotes and never double quotes.
- Stay consistent with units, i.e., do not use a mixture of ~rem~ and ~px~ for typography, unless for browser support where a ~rem~ fall back is needed.

### <a name='browser-prefixes'>Browser Prefixes</a>
Figuring out which properties require browser prefixes is a hefty task, but [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com) provides information about browser support and which properties require prefixes. I recommend using [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) if you are comfortable using a task runner.

### <a name='selectors'>Selectors</a>
- Class selectors should be used before ID selectors.
- The universal ~*~ selector should be avoided at all costs.
- Avoid the use of multiple type selectors (also known as descendant selectors) whenever possible, i.e., ~ul li a~.
- If selectors use the same declarations, group them together, i.e., ~h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { ... }~.

### <a name='pseudo-elements-and-pseudo-classes'>Pseudo-elements and Pseudo-classes</a>
When grouping pseudo-elements and classes with other selectors, include after the element they affect.

~~~css
a { ... }
a:hover { ... }
a:visited { ... }
~~~

Always declare the pseudo-elements ~::before~ first and ~::after~ following, but they should always come after element they affect. It is also best practice to include ~content~ property first.

~~~css
h1 { ... }
h1::before { ... }
h1::after {
  content: ' - See below';
}
~~~

## <a name='inspiration'>Inspiration</a>
